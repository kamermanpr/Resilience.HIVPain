<p>We investigated two primary questions: 1) what is the impact of resilience (the ability to overcome and adapt to adversity) on pain intensity and quality of life in HIV-infected individuals with chronic pain, and 2) does chronic HIV-related pain lead to functional impairment. In addressing these two questions we also reported (for the first time) on the use of actigraphy to objectively assess pain-related functional impairment in HIV-related individuals, and we validated two English-language resilience scales in isiZulu. To determine whether any associations we detected were pain-related or merely characteristics of our HIV-infected population as such, we compared the chronic pain cohort with patients recruited from the same patient population, but who did not have chronic pain.</p>

<p>The study was performed on a convenience sample of 197 ambulatory HIV-positive patients (99 with chronic pain and 98 without chronic pain) attending the HIV clinic at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, South Africa. All patients answered questionniares assessing: their pain (intensity, duration, sites), the effect of pain on function and quality of life, and levels of depression, anxiety, and resilience. A subset of 68 participants (37 with chonic pain and 31 without chronic pain) consented to wearing Actical accelerometers for 24-hours per day for 14 days (only the last 7 days were included in the analysis). This subset of participants were used to provide an objective assessment of physical activity. </p>
