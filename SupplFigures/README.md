# Supplementary figures

## Overview
A series of scatter-plots for the supplementary material provided with the manuscript [update when published].

_Note: All activity data are derived from 24-hour accelerometer recordings over a 7-day period (the exception is participant #176, who only had 5 days of recordings)._ 

The plots fall into two categories  
1. Plots of resilience score (from the Resilience Score questionnaire) against:  
    - Median activity over the recording period;   
    - Total time (in minutes) spent in the past week at 0% of maximum activity over the recording period;    
    - Total time (in minutes) spent in the past week at 1-24% of maximum activity over the recording period;     
    - Total time (in minutes) spent in the past week at 25-49% of maximum activity over the recording period;     
    - Total time (in minutes) spent in the past week at 50-74% of maximum activity over the recording period;   
    - Total time (in minutes) spent in the past week at >75% of maximum activity over the recording period.     

2. Plots of median activity over the recording period against:  
    - Pain interference (11-point numerical rating scale, NRS), scored over the last week (recorded at baseline);     
    - Worst pain (11-point NRS), scored over the last week (recorded at baseline);    
    - Least pain (11-point NRS), scored over the last week (recorded at baseline).
