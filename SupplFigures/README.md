# Supplementary figures

## Overview
A series of scatter-plots for the supplementary material provided with the manuscript _[link to be added when published]_.

**Note:**  
- All activity data are derived from 24-hour accelerometer recordings over a 7-day period (the exception is participant #176, who only had 5 days of recordings);  
- 

The plots fall into two categories   

1. Plots of resilience score (from the Resilience Score questionnaire) against:
    - Median activity over the recording period<br> ([Plot-1.pdf](./figures/Plot-1.pdf), [Plot-1.png](./figures/Plot-1.png));
    - Total time (in minutes) spent in the past week at 0% of maximum activity over the recording period<br> ([Plot-2.pdf](./figures/Plot-2.pdf), [Plot-2.png](./figures/Plot-2.png));
    - Total time (in minutes) spent in the past week at 1-24% of maximum activity over the recording period<br>  ([Plot-3.pdf](./figures/Plot-3.pdf), [Plot-3.png](./figures/Plot-3.png));
    - Total time (in minutes) spent in the past week at 25-49% of maximum activity over the recording period<br>  ([Plot-4.pdf](./figures/Plot-4.pdf), [Plot-4.png](./figures/Plot-4.png));
    - Total time (in minutes) spent in the past week at 50-74% of maximum activity over the recording period<br>   ([Plot-5.pdf](./figures/Plot-5.pdf), [Plot-5.png](./figures/Plot-5.png));
    - Total time (in minutes) spent in the past week at >75% of maximum activity over the recording period<br>  ([Plot-6.pdf](./figures/Plot-6.pdf), [Plot-6.png](./figures/Plot-6.png)). 
    
2. Plots of median activity over the recording period against: 
    - Pain interference (11-point numerical rating scale, NRS), scored over the last week (recorded at baseline)<br> ([Plot.bpi-1.pdf](./figures/Plot.bpi-1.pdf), [Plot.bpi-1.png](./figures/Plot.bpi-1.png));
    - Worst pain (11-point NRS), scored over the last week (recorded at baseline)<br> ([Plot.bpi-2.pdf](./figures/Plot.bpi-2.pdf), [Plot.bpi-2.png](./figures/Plot.bpi-2.png));
    - Least pain (11-point NRS), scored over the last week (recorded at baseline)<br> ([Plot-1.pdf](./figures/Plot-1.pdf), [Plot.bpi-3.png](./figures/Plot.bpi-3.png));
    - Presence of pain (yes or no)<br>([Plot.act-1.pdf](./figures/Plot.act-1.pdf), [Plot.act-1.png](./figures/Plot.act-1.png));
    - Age (in years) <br>([Plot.act-2.pdf](./figures/Plot.act-2.pdf), [Plot.act-2.png](./figures/Plot.act-2.png));
    - Sex (male or female) <br>([Plot.act-3.pdf](./figures/Plot.act-3.pdf), [Plot.act-3.png](./figures/Plot.act-3.png));
    - Education (none, completed primary school, completed secondary school, tertiary training) <br>([Plot.act-4.pdf](./figures/Plot.act-4.pdf), [Plot.act-4.png](./figures/Plot.act-4.png));
    - Body mass index (kg/m^2) <br>([Plot.act-5.pdf](./figures/Plot.act-5.pdf), [Plot.act-5.png](./figures/Plot.act-5.png));
    - Employed (yes or no) <br>([Plot.act-6.pdf](./figures/Plot.act-6.pdf), [Plot.act-6.png](./figures/Plot.act-6.png));
    - Resilience (Resilience Scale) <br>([Plot.act-7.pdf](./figures/Plot.act-7.pdf), [Plot.act-7.png](./figures/Plot.act-7.png));
    - Quality of life (EQ5D visual analogue scale) <br>([Plot.act-8.pdf](./figures/Plot.act-8.pdf), [Plot.act-8.png](./figures/Plot.act-8.png));
    - Worries about family, food, health, and money (5-point Likert)<br> ([Plot.act.b-1.pdf](./figures/Plot.act.b-1.pdf), [Plot.act.b-1.png](./figures/Plot.act.b-1.png)).
