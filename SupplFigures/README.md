# Supplementary figures

## Overview
A series of scatter-plots for the supplementary material provided with the manuscript _[link to be added when published]_.

**Note:**  
- All activity data are derived from 24-hour accelerometer recordings over a 7-day period (the exception is participant #176, who only had 5 days of recordings);  
- 


The plots fall into two categories   

1. Plots of resilience score (from the Resilience Score questionnaire) against:
    - Median activity over the recording period ([Plot-1.pdf](./figures/Plot-1.pdf), [Plot-1.png](./figures/Plot-1.png));
    - Total time (in minutes) spent in the past week at 0% of maximum activity over the recording period ([Plot-1.pdf](./figures/Plot-2.pdf), [Plot-1.png](./figures/Plot-2.png));
    - Total time (in minutes) spent in the past week at 1-24% of maximum activity over the recording period ([Plot-1.pdf](./figures/Plot-3.pdf), [Plot-1.png](./figures/Plot-3.png));
    - Total time (in minutes) spent in the past week at 25-49% of maximum activity over the recording period ([Plot-1.pdf](./figures/Plot-4.pdf), [Plot-1.png](./figures/Plot-4.png));
    - Total time (in minutes) spent in the past week at 50-74% of maximum activity over the recording period ([Plot-1.pdf](./figures/Plot-5.pdf), [Plot-1.png](./figures/Plot-5.png));
    - Total time (in minutes) spent in the past week at >75% of maximum activity over the recording period ([Plot-1.pdf](./figures/Plot-6.pdf), [Plot-1.png](./figures/Plot-6.png)). 
    
2. Plots of median activity over the recording period against: 
    - Pain interference (11-point numerical rating scale, NRS), scored over the last week (recorded at baseline);
    - Worst pain (11-point NRS), scored over the last week (recorded at baseline);
    - Least pain (11-point NRS), scored over the last week (recorded at baseline).    

Code sheets for the data are provided below.
